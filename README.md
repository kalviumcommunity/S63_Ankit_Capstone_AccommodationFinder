Capstone Project
***Student-Oriented Accommodation & Food Solution Platform***

*Project Overview*


This project aims to develop a web-based platform that connects students looking for accommodation with those who have vacant rooms or flats. It also integrates food solutions by collaborating with local tiffin services. The platform specifically targets students and working professionals facing accommodation and food challenges, particularly in Jagatpura, Jaipur, a hub of multiple universities and schools.

**Problem Statement**

1. Limited Hostel Capacity: University hostels can accommodate only a fraction of the admitted students, leaving many to search for PGs or flats. 		
    (Student intake>>hostels availabe)
2. Strict Hostel Rules & Poor Facilities: Hostels impose curfews and have limited facilities, making them less preferable for many students.
3. Vacant Rooms & Financial Burden: Students living in rented flats with vacant rooms struggle to find flatmates, increasing their rental expenses.
4. Difficulty for Freshers & Parents: New students and their families struggle to secure safe and comfortable accommodation before the academic session starts.
5. Security Concerns for Female Students: Finding safe accommodation with security measures is a significant challenge.
6. Food Management Issues: Students face difficulty in managing their food requirements while focusing on studies, and cooking is often not feasible.

**Proposed Solution**

1. Accommodation Matching
    Students with vacant rooms can list their available spaces.
    Students searching for accommodation can filter and connect with potential flatmates.
    Customizable filters based on budget, location, furnishing, security, and amenities.
    Premium verified listings for secure accommodations, especially for female students.

2. Batch-Based Flatmate Matching
    New students (freshers) can register early and find flatmates from their own university and course batch.
    Registration based on offer letters ensures authentic student matching.
    Helps students share accommodation with their classmates, fostering better adjustment and collaboration.

3. Food Solution Integration
    Partnering with local tiffin services to provide affordable, quality meal plans.
    Subscription-based food services with user ratings and reviews.
    Option to customize meal plans based on dietary preferences.


**Business Model & Monetization Strategy**

1. Basic Listings (Free): Students can list and search for accommodation for free.
2. Premium Listings (Paid): Verified and featured listings with additional visibility.
3. Subscription Plans: Paid access for users seeking roommates through advanced matching.
4. Commission-Based Partnerships: Collaborations with brokers, landlords, and tiffin service providers.
5. Verified Secure Accommodation: Listings with security measures (CCTV, security guards) targeted at female students.


**Future Planning & Expected Outcomes**
1. A fully functional web application that effectively connects students for accommodation and food services.
2. Initial traction among students in Jagatpura, Jaipur.
3. Future plans to collaborate with real estate brokers, landlords, and food providers for expansion.
4. Potential to scale the platform to other university hubs across India.

**Technical Implementation**

    Frontend: React.js (for an interactive user experience)
    Backend: Node.js with Express.js (to handle API requests and data processing)
    Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL (to store user data, accommodation listings, and transactions)
    Authentication: JWT-based authentication with Google/Facebook login integration
    Hosting: AWS/GCP/DigitalOcean (for server and database deployment)



**Conclusion**
This project provides a structured and secure platform addressing critical student issues related to accommodation and food. With a strong business model and scope for future expansion, it has the potential to develop into a successful startup in the long run.
